- 1 Pack of Pillsbury Original Grands Biscuits (Makes 16)
<br /> 📝. We also like the Pillsbury Grands Southern Homestyle
- Vegetable Oil

For Glaze:
- 4 Cups Powdered Sugar
- 1-2 Tablespoods Milk
- 1 Tsp Vanilla

### Instructions
For the Donuts: 
1. Pour Vegetable Oil so that you have about 1.5-2 inches in bottom of pan.
2. Heat Vegatable Oil to 250-275 degrees.
3. Split each biscuit in half and create a whole in the middle to make donut shape.
4. Place biscuit in the oil until golden brown, usually just a couple minutes.
5. Flip biscuit to cook other side.
6. Remove from oil and place on plate with a paper towel to pull off excess oil.
7. We won't judge if you want to try one now 😉
8. While they are still warm, throw in the bowl of glaze (see below) and coat both sides
9. Remove from glaze
10. Enjoy! 🍩  (Try not eating them all, it's hard)

For the Glaze: 
1. In separate bowl add Powered Sugar, Milk, and Vanilla
<br /> 📝. You may have to start light on the milk and keep adding some in, if you get to much milk it will be too runny.
2. Whisk until no more clumps.
3. Set aside until donuts are ready.
